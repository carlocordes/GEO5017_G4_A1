Assignment 1 (Linear Regression) as part of the TU Delft course: "Machine learning for the built environment"

###### Question 1.1 - What do we need to do with the data before we can formulate a linear regression problem? Use one short sentence to answer this question. (10%)
Answer: Assume a model (or an equation), identify the independent variable (input, in this case: t) and dependent variable (in this case, output: x). 
###### Question 1.2 - What would be the optimal solution given your hypothesized model? Use one short sentence to answer this question. (10%)
Answer: The optimal solution is obtained by determine the best parameters that minimize the sum of squared-errors (SSE), using closed-form solution or gradient descent solver
